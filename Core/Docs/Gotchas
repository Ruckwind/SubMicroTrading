GOTCHA 1)  careful shifting

        long _curPageNoKeyMask;
        int _curPageNo = 1;
        _curPageNoKeyMask   = _curPageNo << 32L;

because curPageNo is an INT the result is 1 not 4GB !!  Need this :-

        _curPageNoKeyMask   = (long)_curPageNo << 32L;

The same holds true for multiplication, if _instanceSeed is int then mult by factor can overflow and give -ve number
        _counter = _instanceSeed * factor + msecsSinceStartOFDay;

        
2) Fields vars are initialised, local vars are NOT

3) careful shifting right use >>> to insert 0  in far left (unless casting down to byte where the new leftmost bits are not required)

4) dont run java from shell script without nohup & as when the shell exits while the java program is in shutdown hooks and terminates prematurely

5) keep methods small, large methods confuse the compiler and can be RECOMPILED many times
        
6) local binding didnt work with IPV6 ... run with -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true

7) beware complex lines can be recompiled

        order.setClientProfile( (OMClientProfile) msg.getClient() );
        _orderMap.put( _reusableStringFactory.get().copy( msg.getClOrdId() ), order );

8) avoid static factory pools !

9) be aware of the lifecycle of keys in maps, eg dont put a clOrdId from an event which may be recycled !
