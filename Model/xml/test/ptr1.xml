        fix sub groups have now been added, but restrictions are
        
        a) the counter must be the first entry directly preceeding the grp as in fast fix sequences
        b) fix subgroup must have same name as model sub group
        c) ALL possible fix entries in repeating group must be in the fix sub grp definition
           otherwise it can trigger early return from sub grp processing which stops on unexpected tag
           These tags dont need to be added to the internal model tho
           
        d) MUST BE CAREFUL, WHEN EXCHANGE CHANGE FIX SUB EVENTS THEY MUST BE UPDATED IN MODEL
